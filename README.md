# WLU-Go
WLU Go is a web application that allows users to view, rate, and review the courses offered at Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU). It would help students get an idea of what a course is like by reading reviews and different rating parameters. As of now, there is no dedicated way for WLU students to get a thorough understanding of the courses offered other than through word of mouth. We want WLU Go to be a one-stop universal web application that is easily accessible and provides information on any WLU course with just a quick course code search.
